Summary
In this Python machine learning project, we learned to detect the presence of Parkinsonâ€™s Disease in individuals using various factors. We used an XGBClassifier for this and made use of the sklearn library to prepare the dataset. This gives us an accuracy of 94.87%, which is great considering the number of lines of code in this python project.
